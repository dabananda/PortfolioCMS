# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:**

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward all community members
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and lived experiences
- Giving constructive feedback gracefully, and receiving it with openness
- Taking responsibility for our mistakes, apologizing to those affected, and growing from the experience
- Prioritizing the well-being of the overall community, not just individual interests

**Examples of unacceptable behavior include:**

- Use of sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment of any community member
- Publishing another person's private information — such as a physical address or email — without their explicit consent
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and upholding our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take prompt, appropriate, and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces — including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, discussions, and communication channels. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces, such as conferences, meetups, or social media.
